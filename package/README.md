#### 2. Create Input

**Webex Scheduled Meetings Input**

The **Webex Scheduled Meetings** input is used to fetch the active scheduled meetings from [Meetings](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/meetings/list-meetings) endpoint. It allows users to retrieve account-wide scheduled meetings of all users in your organization.

Query parameters used for this input:
- `meetingType: scheduledMeeting`
- `hostEmail: <HOST_EMAIL>`, where all HOST_EMAILs are getting from [List People](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/people/list-people) endpoint

**Note: In order to avoid ingesting duplicate meetings, each scheduled meeting will be only ingested when it reaches its start time. It doesnâ€™t pull in the future scheduled meetings whose start time is in the future.**

The `Interval` is required. It's used to specify how often it hits the Webex Meetings endpoint to pull the scheduled meetings in. The ingestion time increase as the number of users increases. If you have more than 100 users in your organization, it's recommended to set the interval to be at least 300 (5 mins).

The `Start Time` is required. Set the starting date and time to fetch the scheduled meetings. The Start time is inclusive and should be in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ (example:2023-01-01T00:00:00Z). This input aims to get active scheduled meetings, it's recommended to set Start Time to the current time. For example, the current time is `2023-08-01T10:05:28Z`, you can set it as `2023-08-01T00:00:00Z`. If you'd like to get all historical meetings, please use the **Webex Meetings Summary Report Input**.

The `End Time` is optional. If you set it to be a specific date, only the scheduled meetings within the time range from Start Date to End Date will be ingested. The format should be YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ (example:2023-02-01T00:00:00Z).

The input uses checkpointing to avoid ingesting duplicate data. After the initial run, the script will save the end time of the last round as the checkpoint, and will be used as the `Start Time` (advancing by one second) for the next run.

- Click on the `Inputs` button on the top left corner.
- Click on `Create New Input` button on the top right corner.
- Enter the following details in the pop-up box:
    - **Name** (_required_): Unique name for the data input.
    - **Interval** (_required_): Time interval of input in seconds.
    - **Index** (_required_): Index for storing data.
    - **Global Account** (_required_): Select the account created during Configuration.
    - **Start Time** (_required_): Start date and time (inclusive) in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ. It's recommended to set Start Time to the current time. For example, the current time is `2023-08-01T10:05:28Z`, you can set it as `2023-08-01T00:00:00Z`.
    - **End Time** (_optional_): End date and time in the format YYYY-Mon-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.(Optional), `example:2023-02-01T00:00:00Z`. End Time must be after the Start Time.
- Click on the `Add` green button on the bottom right of the pop-up box.

**Webex Meetings Summary Report Input**

The **Webex Meetings Summary Report** input is used to fetch the data from both [Meeting Usage Reports](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/meetings-summary-report/list-meeting-usage-reports) endpoint and [Meeting Attendee Reports](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/meetings-summary-report/list-meeting-attendee-reports) endpoint. It allows users to retrieve account-wide reports on past meetings and their correlated meeting attendees.

**Please Note**: The input only returns the **historical** meeting reports and attendee reports, since these two endpoints only contain historical data. The input will have a few hours delay due to the API behavior. Typically, meeting data is not showing up in the API until 2 to 3 hours after the meetings end. Therefore, the meetings data is only ingested 2 to 3 hours after the meetings end.

The `Start Time` is required. Set the starting date and time to fetch meetings & attendees. The Start Time is inclusive and should be in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ (example:2023-01-01T00:00:00Z). The interval between Start Time and End Time cannot exceed 30 days and Start Time cannot be earlier than 90 days ago.

The `End Time` is optional. If you set it to be a specific date, only reports within the time range from Start Time to End Time will be ingested. The format should be YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ (example:2023-02-01T00:00:00Z). The interval between Start Time and End Time cannot exceed 30 days. Leave it blank if an ongoing ingestion mode is needed.

The input uses checkpointing to avoid ingesting duplicate data. After the initial run, the script will save the latest meeting start time as the checkpoint, and will be used as the `Start Time` (advancing by one second) for the next run.

- Click on the `Inputs` button on the top left corner.
- Click on `Create New Input` button on the top right corner.
- Enter the following details in the pop-up box:
    - **Name** (_required_): Unique name for the data input.
    - **Interval** (_required_): Time interval of input in seconds.
    - **Index** (_required_): Index for storing data.
    - **Global Account** (_required_): Select the account created during Configuration.
    - **Site Name** (_required_): Site Name of the Webex Meeting account. `example: example.webex.com`
    - **Start Time** (_required_): Start date and time (inclusive) in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ, `example:2023-01-01T00:00:00Z`. The interval between Start Time and End Time cannot exceed 30 days and Start Time cannot be earlier than 90 days ago.
    - **End Time** (_optional_): End date and time in the format YYYY-Mon-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.(Optional), `example:2023-02-01T00:00:00Z`. Leave it blank if an ongoing ingestion mode is needed. The interval between Start Time and End Time cannot exceed 30 days.
- Click on the `Add` green button on the bottom right of the pop-up box.

The Start time is inclusive and should be in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ (example:2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z). If you leave the `End Time` blank, Start Time **MUST** be within one year from the current time.

The `End Time` is optional. If you set it to be a specific date, only logs within the time range from Start Date to End Date will be ingested. The format should be YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ (example:2023-02-01T00:00:00.000Z).

**Please Note**: Due to the API behavior, the selected time range cannot be more than a year. Therefore, If you want to obtain the audit logs that happened more than one year ago, you **MUST** fill in both `Start Time` and `End Time`, and ensure that the range does not exceed one year.

The input uses checkpointing to avoid ingesting duplicate data. After the initial run, the script will save the latest audit event created time as the checkpoint, and will be used as the `Start Time` (advancing by one millisecond) for the next run.
